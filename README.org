#+title: Git Masterclass

The file fizzbuzz.py contains some starter code, working as a group
flesh out the simple program in groups of 2 or more and split the work
among the members of the group.

The functions =is_multiple_of_3= =is_multiple_of_5=, and =is_fizz_buzz= need
to be filled.

** Branches
Create a branch for each feature i.e. function, fill it then merge
back into the main branch. Since everyone should be working on
different bits of the code there should not be any merge conflict.

** Merge Conflict 
For the final task, everyone in the group should write doc strings for
the the functions =is_multiple_of_3= and =is_multiple_of_5= then try to
merge it back into the main
